#? Tuples : are a collection of datatypes which is ordered and immutable. 
# once a tuple is created we can't change it's values 
# we can't use add , insert , remove methods in tuple because it's nature is immutable.
# This is particularly useful when a function needs to return more than one piece of information.
        #? Example :
        #  def get_user_info() 
        # return username, email, age
        # user_info = get_user_info () 
        # username , email , age = user_info

# example 2 : i might use tuples to represent fixed collection of coordinates (x,y,z)
