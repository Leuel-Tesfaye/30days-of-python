# Assignment operators : > , < , = , != 

# Arithmetic operators : + - % * 

# comparison operators : 

print (3 > 2)
print( 3 >= 2)
print(len('mango') == len('orange'))
print(len('mango') != len('orange'))

# In addition python uses the following comparison :
#? is: Returns true if both variables are the same object(x is y)
#? is not: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
#? in: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(x in y)
#? not in: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(x in y)

print('1 is 1', 1 is 1)
print('2 is not 1', 2 is not 1)
print('H in Hope', "H" in 'Hope')
print('H not in Hope', "H" not in 'Hope')

#! logical operators 
print( 3 > 2 and 4 > 3)
print (not True)
print(not not False)
